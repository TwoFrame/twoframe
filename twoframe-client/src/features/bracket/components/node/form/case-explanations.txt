Short explanation on whhen a node is controllabe. Made for future reference
Will prob need to update if this logic doesn't work and bugs occur...

A node in the bracket can be CONTROLLABLE under these conditions:

1. Tournament is currently in a "playing" state

2. A match fulfills one of the four cases:

CASE (A)
The match node is a Round 1 or 2 node, with no sources, and no winner has been set.
Easiest case. When a tournament first starts round 1 nodes will be the only editable nodes

Here are the allowed actions in Case A
- Set player1
- Set player2
- Set score1
- Set score2
- Set a winner


CASE (B)
The match has exactly one player source it depends on and this player source is filled, 
and no winner has been set

This essentially mean the node relies on one previous node result.

Here are the allowed actions in Case B
- Undo the player source, making this node not CONTROLLABLE again.
- Set the remaining player (as one of the players has already been filled by source result)
- Set score1
- Set score2
- Set a winner

CASE (C)
The match has exactly 2 player sources it depends on and only one of them is satisfied.

Here are the allowed actions in Case C
- Undo the player source, making this node not CONTROLLABLE again.

CASE (D)
The match has exactly 2 player sources it depends on and only BOTH of them are satisfied.

Here are the allowed actions in Case C
- Undo a player source, putting this node into CASE (C)
- Set score1
- Set score2
- Set a winner
